# Reflection

* The hooks that were the easiest was surprisingly the api calls. The hardest, Id say the dark mode since I couldn't figure out 
* It took a couple of hours but have some hours in my sleep to think about how to approach it.
* Easiest part was having the transitions between componenets.
* To be frank, I enjoyed it, Developing an app made for IOS made it harder since there were problems like having photos show up and having formating show up well.
